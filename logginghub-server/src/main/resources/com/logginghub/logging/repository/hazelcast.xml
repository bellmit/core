               Number of seconds to delay to call the MapStore.store(key, value).
               If the value is zero then it is write-through so MapStore.store(key, value)
               will be called as soon as the entry is updated.
               Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds
               value by calling Hazelcast.storeAll(map). Default value is 0.
